# Week 5 Challenge - Password Generator

## Description

A single page that takes some parameters from the user to generate a password of minimum length of 10 characters and maximum length of 64.

## Installation

Just clone or download the repository, and open index.html in your browser. No console viewing is required.

## Usage

Press the 'generate password' button, then you will be prompted for a number of characters between 10 and 64 characters. Any non-number will repeat the prompt, a number outside of the range will alert the user of this and then re-prompt.

The following prompts will ask if you want to include uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. If none of the 4 are selected, the prompts will restart.

Your password will be displayed in the box.
